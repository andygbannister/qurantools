V2 This is the history of the family of Jacob.\r\nJoseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father. V3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves. V4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. \r\nV5 Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more. V6 He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed: V7 behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.” V8 His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?” So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words. V9 Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” V10 But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?” V11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind. \r\nV12 Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. V13 And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” V14 So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. V15 And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, “What are you seeking?” V16 “I am seeking my brothers,” he said, “tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.” V17 And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. V18 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. V19 They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. V20 Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” V21 But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” V22 And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him” — that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. V23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; V24 and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it. \r\nV25 Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. V26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? V27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers heeded him. V28 Then Midianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt. \r\nV29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes V30 and returned to his brothers, and said, “The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?” V31 Then they took Joseph’s robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood; V32 and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, “This we have found; see now whether it is your son’s robe or not.” V33 And he recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.” V34 Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. V35 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, “No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him. V36 Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Poti-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 39\r\n\r\nV1 Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Poti-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 2 The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian, V3 and his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hands. V4 So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had. V5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in house and field. V6 So he left all that he had in Joseph’s charge; and having him he had no concern for anything but the food which he ate.\r\nNow Joseph was handsome and good-looking. V7 And after a time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, “Lie with me.” V8 But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand; V9 he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” V10 And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her. V11 But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, V12 she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house. V13 And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house, V14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice; V15 and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house.” V16 Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, V17 and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me; V18 but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house.” \r\nV19 When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger was kindled. V20 And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. V21 But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. V22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it; V23 the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph’s care, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 40\r\n\r\nV1 Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. 2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker, V3 and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined. V4 The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody. V5 And one night they both dreamed — the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison — each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning. V6 When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were troubled. V7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why are your faces downcast today?” V8 They said to him, “We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you.” \r\nV9 So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me, V10 and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. V11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.” V12 Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days; V13 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler. V14 But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. V15 For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.” \r\nV16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, V17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.” V18 And Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; V19 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head — from you! — and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.” \r\nV20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants. V21 He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand; V22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. V23 Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 41\r\n\r\nV1 After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile, 2 and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows sleek and fat, and they fed in the reed grass. V3 And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. V4 And the gaunt and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke. V5 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. V6 And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. V7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. V8 So in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharaoh. \r\nV9 Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, “I remember my faults today. V10 When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, V11 we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning. V12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard; and when we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. V13 And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.” \r\nV14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. V15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” V16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.” V17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile; V18 and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass; V19 and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. V20 And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows, V21 but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke. V22 I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good; V23 and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, V24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.” \r\nV25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. V26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one. V27 The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. V28 It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. V29There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, V30 but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land, V31 and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous. V32 And the doubling of Pharaoh’s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. V33 Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. V34 Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years. V35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. V36 That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.” \r\nV37  This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants. V38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?” V39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are; V40you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.” V41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” V42 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; V43 and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, “Bow the knee!” Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. V44 Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” V45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. \r\nV46 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt. 47 During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly, 48 and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it. 49 And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured. \r\nV50 Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 51 Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh, “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s house.” 52 The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” \r\nV53 The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end; 54 and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.” 56 So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 57 Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 42\r\n\r\nV1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” 2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live, and not die.” V3 So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. V4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might befall him. V5 Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. \r\nV6 Now Joseph was governor over the land; he it was who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. V7 Joseph saw his brothers, and knew them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” V8 Thus Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him. V9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them; and he said to them, “You are spies, you have come to see the weakness of the land.” V10 They said to him, “No, my lord, but to buy food have your servants come. V11 We are all sons of one man, we are honest men, your servants are not spies.” V12 He said to them, “No, it is the weakness of the land that you have come to see.” V13 And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.” V14 But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies. V15 By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. V16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” V17 And he put them all together in prison for three days. \r\nV18 On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God: V19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in your prison, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, V20 and bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so. V21 Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us and we would not listen; therefore is this distress come upon us.” V22 And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the lad? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.” V23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. V24 Then he turned away from them and wept; and he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. V25 And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them. \r\nV26 Then they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed. V27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack; V28 and he said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?” \r\nV29 When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying, V30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the land. V31 But we said to him, ‘We are honest men, we are not spies; V32 we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’ V33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. V34 Bring your youngest brother to me; then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver to you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.’” \r\nV35  As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed. V36 And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin; all this has come upon me.” V37 Then Reuben said to his father, “Slay my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.” V38 But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm should befall him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.” \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 43\r\n\r\nV1 Now the famine was severe in the land. 2 And when they had eaten the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” V3 But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ V4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food; V5 but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” V6 Israel said, “Why did you treat me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?” V7 They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions; could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?” V8 And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. V9 I will be surety for him; of my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever; V10 for if we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.” \r\nV11 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. V12 Take double the money with you; carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. V13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man; V14 may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may send back your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.” V15 So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. \r\nV16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” V17 The man did as Joseph bade him, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. V18 And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, to make slaves of us and seize our asses.” V19 So they went up to the steward of Joseph’s house, and spoke with him at the door of the house, V20 and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food; V21 and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was every man’s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it again with us, V22 and we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” V23 He replied, “Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. V24 And when the man had brought the men into Joseph’s house, and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their asses provender, V25 they made ready the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there. \r\nV26 When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them, and bowed down to him to the ground. V27 And he inquired about their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” V28 They said, “Your servant our father is well, he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads and made obeisance. V29And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!” V30 Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. V31 Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, “Let food be served.” V32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. V33 And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement. V34 Portions were taken to them from Joseph’s table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 44\r\n\r\nV1 Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack, 2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him. V3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses. V4 When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup? V5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he divines? You have done wrong in so doing.’” \r\nV6 When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. V7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! V8 Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? V9 With whomever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.” V10 He said, “Let it be as you say: he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be blameless.” V11 Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack. V12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. V13 Then they rent their clothes, and every man loaded his ass, and they returned to the city. \r\nV14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell before him to the ground. V15 Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?” V16 And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.” V17 But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.” \r\nV18 Then Judah went up to him and said, “O my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself. V19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ V20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children; and his father loves him.’ V21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.’ V22 We said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ V23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’ V24 When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord. V25 And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’ V26 we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ V27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons; V28 one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since. V29If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.’ V30 Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the lad’s life, V31 when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. V32 For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.’ V33 Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord; and let the lad go back with his brothers. V34 For how can I go back to my father if the lad is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would come upon my father.” \r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 45\r\n\r\nV1 Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, “Make every one go out from me.” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 2 And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it. V3 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence. \r\nV4 So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, I pray you.” And they came near. And he said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. V5 And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. V6 For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. V7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. V8 So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. V9 Make haste and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry; V10 you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have; V11 and there I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come; lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.’ V12 And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. V13 You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here.” V14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. V15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him. \r\nV16 When the report was heard in Pharaoh’s house, “Joseph’s brothers have come,” it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well. V17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan; V18 and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’ V19 Command them also, ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. V20 Give no thought to your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’” \r\nV21 The sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. V22 To each and all of them he gave festal garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five festal garments. V23 To his father he sent as follows: ten asses loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey. V24 Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way.” V25 So they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob. V26 And they told him, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them. V27 But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived; V28 and Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die.” \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 46\r\n\r\nV1 So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2 And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here am I.” V3 Then he said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation. V4 I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes.” V5 Then Jacob set out from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. V6 They also took their cattle and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him, V7 his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt. \r\nV8 Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, V9 and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. V10 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanitish woman. V11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. V12 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. V13 The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. V14 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel V15 (these are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah; altogether his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three). V16 The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. V17 The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchi-el V18 (these are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob — sixteen persons). V19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. V20 And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, bore to him. V21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard V22 (these are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob — fourteen persons in all). V23 The sons of Dan: Hushim. V24 The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem V25 (these are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob — seven persons in all). V26 All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including Jacob’s sons’ wives, were sixty-six persons in all; V27 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy. \r\nV28 He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to appear before him in Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. V29Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. V30 Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.” V31 Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me; V32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’ V33 When Pharaoh calls you, and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ V34 you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 47\r\n\r\nV1 So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; they are now in the land of Goshen.” 2 And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh. V3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.” V4 They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land; for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” V5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. V6 The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.” \r\nV7 Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. V8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?” V9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.” V10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. V11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. V12 And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their dependents. \r\nV13 Now there was no food in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. V14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. V15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us food; why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.” V16 And Joseph answered, “Give your cattle, and I will give you food in exchange for your cattle, if your money is gone.” V17 So they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the asses: and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their cattle that year. V18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lords; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. V19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be slaves to Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.” \r\nV20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe upon them. The land became Pharaohs; V21 and as for the people, he made slaves of them from one end of Egypt to the other. V22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh, and lived on the allowance which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land. V23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. V24 And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.” V25 And they said, “You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be slaves to Pharaoh.” V26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaohs. \r\nV27 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly. V28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years. \r\nV29 And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, V30 but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.” V31 And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 48\r\n\r\nV1 After this Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill”; so he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2 And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you”; then Israel summoned his strength, and sat up in bed. V3 And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, V4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’ V5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. V6 And the offspring born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. V7 For when I came from Paddan, Rachel to my sorrow died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” \r\nV8 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?” V9 Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them.” V10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them. V11 And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and lo, God has let me see your children also.” V12 Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. V13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near him. V14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the first-born. V15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has led me all my life long to this day, V16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.” \r\nV17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. V18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this one is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head.” V19 But his father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.” V20 So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh”; and thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. V21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. V22 Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.” \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 49\r\n\r\nV1 Then Jacob called his sons, and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in days to come. 2 Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel your father. V3 Reuben, you are my first-born, my might, and the first fruits of my strength, pre-eminent in pride and pre-eminent in power. V4 Unstable as water, you shall not have pre-eminence because you went up to your father’s bed; then you defiled it — you went up to my couch! V5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords. V6 O my soul, come not into their council; O my spirit, be not joined to their company; for in their anger they slay men, and in their wantonness they hamstring oxen. V7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel. V8 Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons shall bow down before you. V9 Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lioness; who dares rouse him up? V10 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. V11 Binding his foal to the vine and his ass’s colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes; V12 his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. V13 Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; he shall become a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sidon. V14 Issachar is a strong ass, crouching between the sheepfolds; V15 he saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant; so he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a slave at forced labor. V16 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. V17 Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that his rider falls backward. V18 I wait for thy salvation, O LORD. V19 Raiders shall raid Gad, but he shall raid at their heels. V20 Asher’s food shall be rich, and he shall yield royal dainties. V21 Naphtali is a hind let loose, that bears comely fawns. V22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall. V23 The archers fiercely attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him sorely; V24 yet his bow remained unmoved, his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel), V25 by the God of your father who will help you, by God Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that couches beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb. V26 The blessings of your father are mighty beyond the blessings of the eternal mountains, the bounties of the everlasting hills; may they be on the head of Joseph, and on the brow of him who was separate from his brothers. V27 Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey, and at even dividing the spoil.” \r\nV28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel; and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. V29Then he charged them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, V30 in the cave that is in the field at Mach-pelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. V31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah — V32 the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.” V33 When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER 50\r\n\r\nV1 Then Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him. V2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel; V3 forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. \r\nV4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, V5 My father made me swear, saying, ‘I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.’ Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return.” V6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” V7 So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, V8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. V9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company. V10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. V11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan. V12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them; V13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Mach-pelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place. V14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. \r\nV15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.” V16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died, V17 ‘Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.’ And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. V18 His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” V19 But Joseph said to them, “Fear not, for am I in the place of God? V20 As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. V21 So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he reassured them and comforted them. \r\nV22 So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. V23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees. V24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” V25 Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, “God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” V26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\r\n\r\n(Revised Standard Version; RSV)','See Droge, A.

He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.\r\nV4 But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. V5 Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried to his god; and they threw the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down, and was fast asleep. V6 So the captain came and said to him, “What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call upon your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we do not perish.”\r\nV7 And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. V8 Then they said to him, “Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And whence do you come? What is your country? And of what people are you?” V9 And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” V10 Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.\r\nV11 Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea grew more and more tempestuous. V12 He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you; for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.” V13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. V14 Therefore they cried to the Lord, “We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not on us innocent blood; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.” V15 So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.

Now Nin′eveh was an exceedingly great city, three days’ journey in breadth. V4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day’s journey.

V7 And he made proclamation and published through Nin′eveh, “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, or drink water, V8 but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them cry mightily to God; yea, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence which is in his hands. V9 Who knows, God may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we perish not?”\r\nV10 When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did not do it.\r\n\r\n<B>CHAPTER 4</B>\r\nV1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. V2 And he prayed to the Lord and said, “I pray thee, Lord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and repentest of evil. V3 Therefore now, O Lord, take my life from me, I beseech thee, for it is better for me to die than to live.” V4 And the Lord said, “Do you do well to be angry?” V5 Then Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.\r\nV6 And the Lord God appointed a plant, and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. V7 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm which attacked the plant, so that it withered. V8 When the sun rose, God appointed a sultry east wind, and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah so that he was faint; and he asked that he might die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” V9 But God said to Jonah, “Do you do well to be angry for the plant?” And he said, “I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.” V10 And the Lord said, “You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night, and perished in a night.

And as the blessed Mary was sitting there, she looked up to the foliage of the palm, and saw it full of fruit, and said to Joseph: I wish it were possible to get some of the fruit of this palm. And Joseph said to her: I wonder that thou sayest this, when thou seest how high the palm tree is; and that thou thinkest of eating of its fruit. I am thinking more of the want of water, because the skins are now empty, and we have none wherewith to refresh ourselves and our cattle. \r\nV2 Then the child Jesus, with a joyful countenance, reposing in the bosom of His mother, said to the palm: O tree, bend thy branches, and refresh my mother with thy fruit.

And after they had gathered all its fruit, it remained bent down, waiting the order to rise from Him who bad commanded it to stoop.

Then immediately she found herself stripped naked, and she saw the hatefulness of her shame, and she ran away naked, and hid herself in another tree, and covered her nakedness with the leaves thereof. And she cried out to Adam, and he came to her, and she handed to him some of the fruit of which she had eaten, and he also did eat thereof. \r\nAnd when he had eaten he also became naked, and he and Eve made girdles for their loins of the leaves of the fig-trees; and they were arrayed in these girdles of ignominy for three hours. At mid-day they received [their] sentence of doom. And God made for them tunics of skin which was stripped from the trees, that is to say, of the bark of the trees, because the trees that were in Paradise had soft barks, and they were softer than the byssus and silk wherefrom the garments worn by kings are made. And God dressed them in this soft skin, which was thus spread over a body of infirmities.',''),(63,7,80,83,'GENESIS','7:1-29','V1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. V2 “My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”\r\n“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”\r\nV3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. V4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. V5 They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”\r\nV6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him V7 and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing. V8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”\r\nV9 “Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.\r\nV10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. V11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.\r\nV12 The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, V13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”\r\nV14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.\r\nV15 With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”\r\nV16 When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord was merciful to them. V17 As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”\r\nV18 But Lot said to them, “No, my lords, please! V19 Your servant has found favor in your[d] eyes, and you[e] have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die. V20 Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”\r\nV21 He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. V22 But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.)\r\n23 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.

What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt? V12 Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians’?

They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. V2 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. V3 The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.\r\n\r\nV4 A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span. V5 He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; V6 on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. V7 His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.\r\n\r\nV8 Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. V9 If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” V10 Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” V11 On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.\r\n\r\nV12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. V13 Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. V14 David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, V15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nV16 For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.\r\n\r\nV17 Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. V18 Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. V19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”\r\n\r\nV20 Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. V21 Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. V22 David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. V23 As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. V24 Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.\r\n\r\nV25 Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”\r\n\r\nV26 David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”\r\n\r\nV27 They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”\r\n\r\nV28 When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.”\r\n\r\nV29 “Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” V30 He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. V31 What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.\r\n\r\nV32 David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”\r\n\r\nV33 Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”\r\n\r\nV34 But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, V35 I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. V36 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. V37 The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.”\r\n\r\nSaul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you.”\r\n\r\nV38 Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. V39 David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them.\r\n\r\n“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. V40 Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.\r\n\r\nV41 Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. V42 He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. V43 He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. V44 “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”\r\n\r\nV45 David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. V46 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.

V49 Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.\r\n\r\nV50 So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.',''),(73,3,33,33,'NUMBERS','26:59','The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites in Egypt.

What if only thirty can be found there?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”\r\n\r\nV31 Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”\r\n\r\nHe said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”\r\n\r\nV32 Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”\r\n\r\nV33 When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\nV1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. V2 “My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”\r\n\r\nV3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. V4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. V5 They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”\r\n\r\nV6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him V7 and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing. V8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”\r\n\r\nV9 “Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.\r\n\r\nV10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. V11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.\r\n\r\nV12 The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, V13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”\r\n\r\nV14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.\r\n\r\nV15 With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”\r\n\r\nV16 When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord was merciful to them. V17 As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”\r\n\r\nV18 But Lot said to them, “No, my lords, please! V19 Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die. V20 Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”\r\n\r\nV21 He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. V22 But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.)\r\n\r\n23 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. 24 Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens. 25 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. 26 But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.\r\n\r\n27 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. 28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.\r\n\r\n29 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.\r\n',''),(94,11,62,68,'TABARI-HISTORY-2','II. 245, 249','<font color=gray>(The pre-Islamic story of The She Camel of Salih, retold in the Qur\'an, is described in some detail by Islamic writers such as Al-Ṭabarī (d.923) </font>)<hr>\r\n\r\nWhat happened then regarding them and Salih. was told by al-Hasan b.

V7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. V8 Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, V9 male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.

V14 They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. V15 Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. V16 The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut him in.\r\n\r\nV17 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. V18 The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. V19 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. V20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits. V21 Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. V22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. V23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth.

V2 Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. V3 The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, V4 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. V5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.\r\n\r\nV6 After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark V7 and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. V8 Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. V9 But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. V10 He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. V11 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. V12 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.\r\n\r\nV13 By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth.

He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. V16 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. V17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”\r\n\r\nV18 Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.”\r\n\r\nV19 The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. V20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.”\r\n\r\nV21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. V22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.\r\n\r\nV23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home. V24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 25 “The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”',''),(127,2,259,259,'4BARUCH','5:1-19','V1 But Abimelech took the figs in the burning heat; and coming upon a tree, he sat under its shade to rest a bit.\r\n\r\nV2 And leaning his head on the basket of figs, he fell asleep and slept for 66 years; and he was not awakened from his slumber.\r\n\r\nV3 And afterward, when he awoke from his sleep, he said: \"I slept sweetly for a little while, but my head is heavy because I did not get enough sleep.\"\r\n\r\nV4 Then he uncovered the basket of figs and found them dripping milk.\r\n\r\nV5 And he said: \"I would like to sleep a little longer, because my head is heavy. But I am afraid that I might fall asleep and be late in awakening and my father Jeremiah would think badly of me; for if he were not in a hurry, he would not have sent me today at daybreak. V6 So I will get up, and proceed in the burning heat; for isn\'t there heat, isn\'t there toil every day?\"\r\n\r\nV7 So he got up and took the basket of figs and placed it on his shoulders, and he entered into Jerusalem and did not recognize it -- neither his own house, nor the place -- nor did he find his own family or any of his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nV8 And he said: \"The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me today! V9 This is not the city Jerusalem -- and I have lost my way because I came by the mountain road when I arose from my sleep; and since my head was heavy because I did not get enough sleep, I lost my way. V10 It will seem incredible to Jeremiah that I lost my way!\"\r\n\r\nV11 And he departed from the city; and as he searched he saw the landmarks of the city, and he said: \"Indeed, this is the city; I lost my way.\"\r\n\r\nV12 And again he returned to the city and searched, and found no one of his own people; and he said: \"The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me!\"\r\n\r\nV13 And again he departed from the city, and he stayed there grieving, not knowing where he should go.\r\n\r\nV14  And he put down the basket, saying: \"I will sit here until the Lord takes this trance from me.\"\r\n\r\nV15 And as he sat, he saw an old man coming from the field; and Abimelech said to him: \" I say to you, old man, what city is this?\"\r\n\r\nV16 And he said to him: \"It is Jerusalem.\"\r\n\r\nV17 And Abimelech said to him: \"Where is Jeremiah the priest, and Baruch the secretary, and all the people of this city, for I could not find them?\"\r\n\r\nV18 And the old man said to him: \"Are you not from this city, seeing that you remember Jeremiah today, because you are asking about him after such a long time?

Nimrod suggested to Abraham that since he had refused to worship his father\'s idols because of their want of power, he should worship fire, which is very powerful: Abraham pointed out that water has power over fire. \'Well,\' said Nimrod, \'let us declare water god.\' \'But,\' replied Abraham,\' the clouds absorb the water and even they are dispersed by the wind.\' \'Then let us declare the wind our god.\' \'Bear in mind,\' continued Abraham, \'that man is stronger than wind, and can resist it and stand against it.\'\r\n\r\nNimrod, becoming weary of arguing with Abraham, decided to cast him before his god--fire--and challenged Abraham\'s deliverance by the God of Abraham, but God saved him out of the fiery furnace.',''),(129,2,260,260,'GENESIS','15:6-19','V6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.\r\n\r\nV7 He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”\r\n\r\nV8 But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”\r\n\r\nV9 So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”\r\n\r\nV10 Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. V11 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.\r\n\r\nV12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.

V14 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. V15 You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.

Joseph therefore made haste, and led her to the palm, and made her come down from her beast. And as the blessed Mary was sitting there, she looked up to the foliage of the palm, and saw it full of fruit, and said to Joseph: I wish it were possible to get some of the fruit of this palm. And Joseph said to her: I wonder that thou sayest this, when thou seest how high the palm tree is; and that thou thinkest of eating of its fruit. I am thinking more of the want of water, because the skins are now empty, and we have none wherewith to refresh ourselves and our cattle. \r\nV2 Then the child Jesus, with a joyful countenance, reposing in the bosom of His mother, said to the palm: O tree, bend thy branches, and refresh my mother with thy fruit. And immediately at these words the palm bent its top down to the very feet of the blessed Mary; and they gathered from it fruit, with which they were all refreshed. And after they had gathered all its fruit, it remained bent down, waiting the order to rise from Him who bad commanded it to stoop. Then Jesus said to it: Raise thyself, O palm tree, and be strong, and be the companion of my trees, which are in the paradise of my Father; and open from thy roots a vein of water which has been hid in the earth, and let the waters flow, so that we may be satisfied from thee. And it rose up immediately, and at its root there began to come forth a spring of water exceedingly clear and cool and sparkling. And when they saw the spring of water, they rejoiced with great joy, and were satisfied, themselves and all their cattle and their beasts.

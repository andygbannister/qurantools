Whosoever disdains to serve Him, and waxes proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them.'),(4,173,'Arberry','As for the believers, who do deeds of righteousness, He will pay them in full their wages, and He will give them more, of His bounty; and as for them who disdain, and wax proud, them He will chastise with a painful chastisement, and they shall not find for them, apart from God, a friend or helper.'),(4,174,'Arberry','O men, a proof has now come to you from your Lord; We have sent down to you a manifest light.'),(4,175,'Arberry','As for those who believe in God, and hold fast to Him, He will surely admit them to mercy from Him, and bounty, and will guide them to Him on a straight path.'),(4,176,'Arberry','They will ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: \'God pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs. If a man perishes having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive a half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children. If there be two sisters, they shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves; if there be brothers and sisters, the male shall receive the portion of two females. God makes clear to you, lest you go astray; God has knowledge of everything.'),(5,1,'Arberry','O believers, fulfil your bonds. Permitted to you is the beast of the flocks, except that which is now recited to you, so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity. God decrees whatsoever He desires.'),(5,2,'Arberry','O believers, profane not God\'s waymarks nor the holy month, neither the offering, nor the necklaces, nor those repairing to the Holy House seeking from their Lord bounty and good pleasure. But when you have quit your pilgrim sanctity, then hunt for game. Let not detestation for a people who barred you from the Holy Mosque move you to commit aggression. Help one another to piety and godfearing; do not help each other to sin and enmity. And fear God; surely God is terrible in retribution.'),(5,3,'Arberry','Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been hallowed to other than God, the beast strangled; the beast beaten down, the beast fallen to death, the beast gored, and that devoured by beasts of prey - excepting that you have sacrificed duly -- as also things sacrificed to idols, and partition by the divining arrows; that is ungodliness. Today the unbelievers have despaired of your religion; therefore fear them not, but fear you Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion. But whosoever is constrained in emptiness and not inclining purposely to sin -- God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.'),(5,4,'Arberry','They will question thee what is permitted them. Say: \'The good things are permitted you; and such hunting creatures as you teach, training them as hounds, and teaching them as God has taught you -- eat what they seize for you, and mention God\'s Name over it. Fear God; God is swift at the reckoning.\''),(5,5,'Arberry','Today the good things are permitted you, and the food of those who were given the Book is permitted to you, and permitted to them is your food; Likewise believing women in wedlock, and in wedlock women of them who were given the Book before you if you give them their wages, in wedlock and not in licence, or as taking lovers. Whoso disbelieves in the faith, his work has failed, and in the world to come he shall be among the losers.'),(5,6,'Arberry','O believers, when you stand up to pray wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet up to the ankles. If you are defiled, purify yourselves; but if you are sick or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the privy, or you have touched women, and you can find no water, then have recourse to wholesome dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God does not desire to make any impediment for you; but He desires to purify you, and that He may complete His blessing upon you; haply you will be thankful.'),(5,7,'Arberry','And remember God\'s blessing upon you, and His compact which He made with you when you said, \'We have heard and we obey. And fear you God; surely God knows the thoughts in the breasts.'),(5,8,'Arberry','O believers, be you securers of justice, witnesses for God. Let not detestation for a people move you not to be equitable; be equitable -- that is nearer to godfearing. And fear God; surely God is aware of the things you do.'),(5,9,'Arberry','God has promised those that believe, and do deeds of righteousness; they shall have; forgiveness and a mighty wage.'),(5,10,'Arberry','And the unbelievers, who cried lies to Our signs -- they shall be the inhabitants of Hell.'),(5,11,'Arberry','O believers, remember God\'s blessing upon you, when a certain people purposed to stretch against you their hands, and He restrained their hands from you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put all their trust.'),(5,12,'Arberry','God took compact with the Children of Israel; and We raised up from among them twelve chieftains. And God said, \'I am with you. Surely, if you perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My Messengers and succour them, and lend to God a good loan, I will acquit you of your evil deeds, and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whosoever of you thereafter disbelieves, surely he has gone astray from the right way.'),(5,13,'Arberry','So for their breaking their compact We cursed them and made their hearts hard, they perverting words from their meanings; and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of; and thou wilt never cease to light upon some act of treachery on their part, except a few of them. Yet pardon them, and forgive; surely God loves the good-doers.'),(5,14,'Arberry','And with those who say \'We are Christians\' We took compact; and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of. So We have stirred up among them enmity and hatred, till the Day of Resurrection; and God will assuredly tell them of the things they wrought.'),(5,15,'Arberry','People of the Book, now there has come to you Our Messenger, making clear to you many things you have been concealing of the Book, and effacing many things. There has come to you from God a light, and a Book Manifest'),(5,16,'Arberry','whereby God guides whosoever follows His good pleasure in the ways of peace, and brings them forth from the shadows into the light by His leave; and He guides them to a straight path.'),(5,17,'Arberry','They are unbelievers who say, \'God is the Messiah, Mary\'s son.\' Say: \'Who then shall overrule God in any way if He desires to destroy the Messiah, Mary\'s son, and his mother, and all those who are on earth?\' For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them, creating what He will.

Indeed, there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner; God is powerful over everything.'),(5,20,'Arberry','And when Moses said to his people, \'O my people, remember God\'s blessing upon you, when He appointed among you Prophets, and appointed you kings, and gave you such as He had not given to any being.'),(5,21,'Arberry','O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you, and turn not back in your traces, to turn about losers.\''),(5,22,'Arberry','They said, \'Moses, there are people in. it very arrogant; we will not enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter.\''),(5,23,'Arberry','Said two men of those that feared God whom God had blessed, \'Enter against them the gate!

He said, \'Woe is me! Am I unable to be as this raven, and so conceal my brother\'s vile body?\' And he became one of the remorseful.'),(5,32,'Arberry','Therefore We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoso slays a soul not to retaliate for a soul slain, nor for corruption done in the land, shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoso gives life to a soul, shall be as if he ha given life to mankind altogether. Our Messengers have already come to them with the clear signs; then many of them thereafter commit excesses in the earth.'),(5,33,'Arberry','This is the recompense of those who fight against God and His Messenger, and hasten about the earth, to do corruption there: they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet shall alternately be struck off; or they shall be banished from the land.
